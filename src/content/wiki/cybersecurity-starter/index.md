## Overview
This starter kit is designed to be scrollable and nested so you can test the wiki navigation. Two folders cover lab setup and incident basics.

### What’s inside
- `labs/lab-setup` — Build a small home lab with VMs and safe targets.
- `incident-response/playbook-basics` — Minimal steps for handling alerts.

## Learning goals
- Practice investigation without breaking prod.
- Capture evidence cleanly.
- Communicate clearly and briefly.

## Core habits
1. Time-stamp everything you do.
2. Keep raw notes and summarize separately.
3. Work from least- to most-destructive actions.
4. Validate assumptions with two signals (log + packet, alert + metric).
